## ResNet18 and ResNet50 on MedMNIST

### Getting start
To train the model and get the output result, simply run the scripts in the ./scripts directory. For example:
```
cd ./scripts/
bash breastmnist1.sh
```
MedMnist contains 10 tasks, and for each tasks, we do experiments on both ResNet18 and ResNet50. xxxx1.sh refers to the scripts for training ResNet18, xxxx2.sh refers to the scripts for training ResNet50
